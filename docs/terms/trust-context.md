Many different factors may be involved in establishing a trust context, such as: the relevant interaction or transaction; the presence or absence of existing [[ref: trust relationships]]; the applicability of one or more [[ref: governance frameworks]]; and the location, time, network, and/or devices involved. A trust context may be implicit or explicit; if explicit, it may be identified using an [[ref: identifier]]. A [[ref: ToIP governance framework]] an example of an explicit trust context identified by a [[ref: ToIP identifier]].

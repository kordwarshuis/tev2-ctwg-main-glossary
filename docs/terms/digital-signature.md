[[def: digital signature]]:

~ A digital signature is a mathematical scheme for verifying the authenticity of digital [[ref: messages]] or documents. A valid digital signature, where the prerequisites are satisfied, gives a recipient very high confidence that the [[ref: message]] was created by a known sender ([authenticity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authentication)), and that the message was not altered in transit ([integrity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_integrity)).
